            \href{http://www.fivestars.com/}{Five Stars Loyalty} & San Francisco, CA \\
        \end{tabular*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designed and built an ML-based service to extract transaction data from the receipt printer stream on Point of Sale devices, to drive our loyalty product
            \item Designed and built a netty-based reverse proxy and virtual receipt printer, as a native plugin to our (Cordova) Android loyalty app
            \item Helped to design and build an Android-based direct API integration between our loyalty product and Clover's Point of Sale
            \item Singlehandedly and successfully migrated our production Postgres instance from Heroku to Amazon RDS with an hour of downtime
            \item Helped port our Cordova-based Android app to run on Windows by building a custom container based on CEF (before Cordova had a Windows port).
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Designed and built an auto-updater that was compatible with our previous (non-Cordova) client which allowed us to push out the new version without customer interaction
                \end{itemize}
            \item Mentored multiple interns, who contributed meaningfully and lastingly to the aforementioned receipt data extraction service and Windows client
            \item Helped migrate Five Stars production from dotCloud to AWS: with two other engineers, designed and implemented a new Docker-based deployment system that took us through four years of growth
            \item Helped build AutoPilot, a feature that allows triggered notifications and offers based on user behavior, which allowed us to triple what we charged to the majority of our merchants
            \item Developed on the (Django) server backend, the (Windows/Python/Qt) point of sale client, and the customer facing android tablet app
        \end{itemize}
